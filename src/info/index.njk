		One night, I was looking for a new domain to buy and stumbled upon
		<em>thisisa.band</em>. It served a completely different purpose at the time, but it wasn't long
		before I thought of a better way to put this internet real estate to use.
		<em>This Is A Band</em>
		is a place for you to spread the word about the bands in your life, but not just for the hell of
		it.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				Did you see this amazing band on your travels in Europe that you'd never heard of and think
				everyone else needs to hear them?
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				While you were on tour with your own band, did you perform alongside just the greatest
				people you'd ever met and feel like everyone else needs to know how great they were?
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Maybe you were going through a tough time a few years ago and this one band was the reason
				you're where you are today?
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Whatever the reason is,
		<em>This is a Band</em>
		is the place to talk about it.
	</p>
	<ul role="list">

		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Want to submit a band?</h3>
	<p>
		Use this form to submit a band to the site. You don't have to give me a name or email, but by
		not doing so I won't be able to attribute the post to you nor would I be able to contact you if
		there's something weird about your submission.
	</p>
	<p>
		Include as much information as you'd like in the submission box. Write your story, include a
		link to a video or song, etc. Please don't write a novel.
	</p>
